# Stove_Reminder
This is the readme file for our project, called Stove Reminder. In here you can read all of the versions of our project as well as the updates to our code.


v0.0.X - Created GitHub folder and basic documents.

v0.1.X - Created template code for when we've got the main components working with the Arduino.

v0.2.X - Added code for IR Sensor and deleted unused folder: "Documents". Tweaks to the code, in terms of a more fitting threshold for the IR Sensor, as well as Serial.println(); lines, to make sure the code works. Also deleted "else if" part of code, there was no need for an else if function, "else" does the trick.
Optimisation of code by creating functions instead of running everything inside of the loop.

Some code for the thermistor.
